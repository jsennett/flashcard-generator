Distributed Systems:
	
    A distributed system is a system that is comprised of several physically disjoint compute resources interconnected by a network, working together to appear as a single coherent system.

Why build a distributed system?:

	- Centralized system is simpler in all respects
	- Scalability limitations
	- Single point of failure
	- Availability and redundancy
	- Many resources are inherently distributed
	- Many resources used in a shared fashion 

Characteristics of a distributed system:

	- Reliable
	- Fault tolerant
	- Highly available
	- Recoverable
	- Consistent
	- Scalable
	- Predictable performance
	- Secure
	- Heterogeneous
	- Open 

Benefits of using Edge Servers:

	Edge servers cache data to provide lower latency and offload work from a central server. 
	
	If edge servers can't answer a request, it is forwarded to the central server.
